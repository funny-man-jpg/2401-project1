# Project 1, Space Program
This program allows the user to input various subsystems and add them to a collection for storage, as well as edit the status of their power, data, activity, error status, performance level, and resource usage.
The program also allows users to print out all revelvant information for individual subsystems or the whole collection. 
The program also allows you to filter subsystems based on their statuses in order to find which ones meet certain criteria.
This is intended to be used to manage the various parts of a rocket.

## Building and Running
1. Open the terminal and use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory the files for the program
2. Type the command `gcc -o p1 subsys.c subsystem.h subsys_collection.c main.c` to compile the program
3. Type the command ls, if there is an executable named p1, it worked.
4. Type the command `./p1` to run the program
